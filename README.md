## üëã Hey there! Thanks for checking out the OpenFeature JavaScript SDKs

### What is OpenFeature?

[OpenFeature][openfeature-website] is an open standard that provides a vendor-agnostic, community-driven API for feature flagging that works with your favorite feature flag management tool.

### Why standardize feature flags?

Standardizing feature flags unifies tools and vendors behind a common interface which avoids vendor lock-in at the code level. Additionally, it offers a framework for building extensions and integrations and allows providers to focus on their unique value proposition.

## üîß Components

This repository contains both the server-side JS and web-browser SDKs.
For details, including API documentation, see the respective README files.

- [Server SDK](./packages/server/README.md), for use in Node.js and similar runtimes.
  - [NestJS SDK](./packages/nest/README.md), a distribution of the Server SDK with built-in NestJS-specific features.
- [Client SDK](./packages/client/README.md), for use in the web browser.
  - [React SDK](./packages/react//README.md), a distribution of the Client SDK with built-in React-specific features.

Each have slightly different APIs, but share many underlying types and components.
