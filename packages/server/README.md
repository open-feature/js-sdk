### Providers

[Providers](https://openfeature.dev/docs/reference/concepts/provider) are an abstraction between a flag management system and the OpenFeature SDK.
Look [here](https://openfeature.dev/ecosystem/?instant_search%5BrefinementList%5D%5Btype%5D%5B0%5D=Provider&instant_search%5BrefinementList%5D%5Bcategory%5D%5B0%5D=Server-side&instant_search%5BrefinementList%5D%5Btechnology%5D%5B0%5D=JavaScript) for a complete list of available providers.
If the provider you're looking for hasn't been created yet, see the [develop a provider](#develop-a-provider) section to learn how to build it yourself.

Once you've added a provider as a dependency, it can be registered with OpenFeature like this:

#### Awaitable

To register a provider and ensure it is ready before further actions are taken, you can use the `setProviderAndWait` method as shown below:

```ts
await OpenFeature.setProviderAndWait(new MyProvider());
```  

#### Synchronous

To register a provider in a synchronous manner, you can use the `setProvider` method as shown below:

```ts
OpenFeature.setProvider(new MyProvider());
```

Once the provider has been registered, the status can be tracked using [events](#eventing).

In some situations, it may be beneficial to register multiple providers in the same application.
This is possible using [named clients](#named-clients), which is covered in more details below.

### Targeting

Sometimes, the value of a flag must consider some dynamic criteria about the application or user, such as the user's location, IP, email address, or the server's location.
In OpenFeature, we refer to this as [targeting](https://openfeature.dev/specification/glossary#targeting).
If the flag management system you're using supports targeting, you can provide the input data using the [evaluation context](https://openfeature.dev/docs/reference/concepts/evaluation-context).

```ts
// set a value to the global context
OpenFeature.setContext({ region: "us-east-1" });

// set a value to the client context
const client = OpenFeature.getClient();
client.setContext({ version: process.env.APP_VERSION });

// set a value to the invocation context
const requestContext = {
  targetingKey: req.session.id,
  email: req.session.email,
  product: req.productId
};

const boolValue = await client.getBooleanValue('some-flag', false, requestContext);
```

### Hooks

[Hooks](https://openfeature.dev/docs/reference/concepts/hooks) allow for custom logic to be added at well-defined points of the flag evaluation life-cycle
Look [here](https://openfeature.dev/ecosystem/?instant_search%5BrefinementList%5D%5Btype%5D%5B0%5D=Hook&instant_search%5BrefinementList%5D%5Bcategory%5D%5B0%5D=Server-side&instant_search%5BrefinementList%5D%5Btechnology%5D%5B0%5D=JavaScript) for a complete list of available hooks.
If the hook you're looking for hasn't been created yet, see the [develop a hook](#develop-a-hook) section to learn how to build it yourself.

Once you've added a hook as a dependency, it can be registered at the global, client, or flag invocation level.

```ts
import { OpenFeature } from "@openfeature/server-sdk";

// add a hook globally, to run on all evaluations
OpenFeature.addHooks(new ExampleGlobalHook());

// add a hook on this client, to run on all evaluations made by this client
const client = OpenFeature.getClient();
client.addHooks(new ExampleClientHook());

// add a hook for this evaluation only
const boolValue = await client.getBooleanValue("bool-flag", false, { hooks: [new ExampleHook()]});
```

### Logging

The JS SDK will log warning and errors to the console by default.
This behavior can be overridden by passing a custom logger either globally or per client.
A custom logger must implement the [Logger interface](../shared/src/logger/logger.ts).

```ts
import type { Logger } from "@openfeature/server-sdk";

// The logger can be anything that conforms with the Logger interface
const logger: Logger = console;

// Sets a global logger 
OpenFeature.setLogger(logger);

// Sets a client logger
const client = OpenFeature.getClient();
client.setLogger(logger);
```

### Named clients

Clients can be given a name.
A name is a logical identifier which can be used to associate clients with a particular provider.
If a name has no associated provider, the global provider is used.

```ts
import { OpenFeature, InMemoryProvider } from "@openfeature/server-sdk";

const myFlags = {
  'v2_enabled': {
    variants: {
      on: true,
      off: false
    },
    disabled: false,
    defaultVariant: "on"
  }
};

// Registering the default provider
OpenFeature.setProvider(InMemoryProvider(myFlags));
// Registering a named provider
OpenFeature.setProvider("otherClient", new InMemoryProvider(someOtherFlags));

// A Client backed by default provider
const clientWithDefault = OpenFeature.getClient();
// A Client backed by NewCachedProvider
const clientForCache = OpenFeature.getClient("otherClient");
```

Named providers can be set in an awaitable or synchronous way.
For more details, please refer to the [providers](#providers) section.

### Eventing

Events allow you to react to state changes in the provider or underlying flag management system, such as flag definition changes, provider readiness, or error conditions.
Initialization events (`PROVIDER_READY` on success, `PROVIDER_ERROR` on failure) are dispatched for every provider.
Some providers support additional events, such as `PROVIDER_CONFIGURATION_CHANGED`.

Please refer to the documentation of the provider you're using to see what events are supported.

```ts
import { OpenFeature, ProviderEvents } from '@openfeature/server-sdk';

// OpenFeature API
OpenFeature.addHandler(ProviderEvents.Ready, (eventDetails) => {
  console.log(`Ready event from: ${eventDetails?.providerName}:`, eventDetails);
});

// Specific client
const client = OpenFeature.getClient();
client.addHandler(ProviderEvents.Error, (eventDetails) => {
  console.log(`Error event from: ${eventDetails?.providerName}:`, eventDetails);
});
```

### Shutdown

The OpenFeature API provides a close function to perform a cleanup of all registered providers.
This should only be called when your application is in the process of shutting down.

```ts
import { OpenFeature } from '@openfeature/server-sdk';

await OpenFeature.close()
```

## Extending

### Develop a provider

To develop a provider, you need to create a new project and include the OpenFeature SDK as a dependency.
This can be a new repository or included in [the existing contrib repository](https://github.com/open-feature/js-sdk-contrib) available under the OpenFeature organization.
You‚Äôll then need to write the provider by implementing the [Provider interface](./src/provider/provider.ts) exported by the OpenFeature SDK.

```ts
import { JsonValue, Provider, ResolutionDetails } from '@openfeature/server-sdk';

// implement the provider interface
class MyProvider implements Provider {
  // Adds runtime validation that the provider is used with the expected SDK
  public readonly runsOn = 'server';

  readonly metadata = {
    name: 'My Provider',
  } as const;

  // Optional provider managed hooks
  hooks?: Hook<FlagValue>[];

  resolveBooleanEvaluation(flagKey: string, defaultValue: boolean, context: EvaluationContext, logger: Logger): Promise<ResolutionDetails<boolean>> {
    // code to evaluate a boolean
  }

  resolveStringEvaluation(flagKey: string, defaultValue: string, context: EvaluationContext, logger: Logger): Promise<ResolutionDetails<string>> {
    // code to evaluate a string
  }

  resolveNumberEvaluation(flagKey: string, defaultValue: number, context: EvaluationContext, logger: Logger): Promise<ResolutionDetails<number>> {
    // code to evaluate a number
  }

  resolveObjectEvaluation<T extends JsonValue>(flagKey: string, defaultValue: T, context: EvaluationContext, logger: Logger): Promise<ResolutionDetails<T>> {
    // code to evaluate an object
  }

  status?: ProviderStatus | undefined;
  events?: OpenFeatureEventEmitter | undefined;

  initialize?(context?: EvaluationContext | undefined): Promise<void> {
    // code to initialize your provider
  }

  onClose?(): Promise<void> {
    // code to shut down your provider
  }
}
```

### Develop a hook

To develop a hook, you need to create a new project and include the OpenFeature SDK as a dependency.
This can be a new repository or included in [the existing contrib repository](https://github.com/open-feature/js-sdk-contrib) available under the OpenFeature organization.
Implement your own hook by conforming to the [Hook interface](../shared/src/hooks/hook.ts).

```ts
import type { Hook, HookContext, EvaluationDetails, FlagValue } from "@openfeature/server-sdk";

export class MyHook implements Hook {
  after(hookContext: HookContext, evaluationDetails: EvaluationDetails<FlagValue>) {
    // code that runs when there's an error during a flag evaluation
  }
}
```
