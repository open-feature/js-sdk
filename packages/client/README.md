## üëã Hey there! Thanks for checking out the OpenFeature Web SDK

### What is OpenFeature?

[OpenFeature][openfeature-website] is an open standard that provides a vendor-agnostic, community-driven API for feature
flagging that works with your favorite feature flag management tool.

### Why standardize feature flags?

Standardizing feature flags unifies tools and vendors behind a common interface which avoids vendor lock-in at the code
level. Additionally, it offers a framework for building extensions and integrations and allows providers to focus on
their unique value proposition.

## üîç Requirements:

- ES2015-compatible web browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, etc)

## üì¶ Installation:

### npm

```sh
npm install @openfeature/web-sdk
```

### yarn

```sh
yarn add @openfeature/web-sdk
```

## üåü Features:

- support for various [providers](https://openfeature.dev/docs/reference/concepts/provider)
- easy integration and extension via [hooks](https://openfeature.dev/docs/reference/concepts/hooks)
- handle flags of any type: bool, string, numeric and object
- [context-aware](https://openfeature.dev/docs/reference/concepts/evaluation-context) evaluation

## üöÄ Usage:

### Basics:

```typescript
import { OpenFeature } from '@openfeature/web-sdk';

// configure a provider
await OpenFeature.setProvider(new YourProviderOfChoice());

// create a client
const client = OpenFeature.getClient('my-app');

// get a bool flag value
const boolValue = client.getBooleanValue('boolFlag', false);
```

### Context-aware evaluation:

Sometimes the value of a flag must take into account some dynamic criteria about the application or user, such as the
user location, IP, email address, or the location of the server.
In OpenFeature, we refer to this as [`targeting`](https://openfeature.dev/specification/glossary#targeting).
If the flag system you're using supports targeting, you can provide the input data using the `EvaluationContext`.

```typescript
// global context for static data
await OpenFeature.setContext({ origin: document.location.host })

// use contextual data to determine a flag value
const boolValue = client.getBooleanValue('some-flag', false);
```

### Providers:

To develop a provider, you need to create a new project and include the OpenFeature SDK as a dependency. This can be a
new repository or included in an existing contrib repository available under the OpenFeature organization. Finally,
you‚Äôll then need to write the provider itself. In most languages, this can be accomplished by implementing the provider
interface exported by the OpenFeature SDK.

```typescript
import { JsonValue, Provider, ResolutionDetails } from '@openfeature/web-sdk';

// implement the provider interface
class MyProvider implements Provider {
  readonly metadata = {
    name: 'My Provider'
  } as const;

  resolveBooleanEvaluation(flagKey: string, defaultValue: boolean): ResolutionDetails<boolean> {
    // resolve a boolean flag value
  }

  resolveStringEvaluation(flagKey: string, defaultValue: string): ResolutionDetails<string> {
    // resolve a string flag value
  }

  resolveNumberEvaluation(flagKey: string, defaultValue: number): ResolutionDetails<number> {
    // resolve a numeric flag value
  }

  resolveObjectEvaluation<T extends JsonValue>(flagKey: string, defaultValue: T): ResolutionDetails<T> {
    // resolve an object flag value
  }
```

See [here](https://openfeature.dev/docs/reference/technologies/server/javascript) for a catalog of available providers.

### Hooks:

Hooks are a mechanism that allow for the addition of arbitrary behavior at well-defined points of the flag evaluation
life-cycle. Use cases include validation of the resolved flag value, modifying or adding data to the evaluation context,
logging, telemetry, and tracking.

```typescript
import { OpenFeature, Hook, HookContext } from '@openfeature/web-sdk';

// Example hook that logs if an error occurs during flag evaluation
export class GlobalDebugHook implements Hook {
  after(hookContext: HookContext, err: Error) {
    console.log('hook context', hookContext);
    console.error(err);
  }
}
```

See [here](https://openfeature.dev/docs/reference/technologies/server/javascript) for a catalog of available hooks.

### Logging:

You can implement the `Logger` interface (compatible with the `console` object, and implementations from common logging
libraries such as [winston](https://www.npmjs.com/package/winston)) and set it on the global API object.

```typescript
// implement logger
class MyLogger implements Logger {
  error(...args: unknown[]): void {
    // implement me
  }

  warn(...args: unknown[]): void {
    // implement me
  }

  info(...args: unknown[]): void {
    // implement me
  }

  debug(...args: unknown[]): void {
    // implement me
  }
}

// set the logger
OpenFeature.setLogger(new MyLogger());
```

### Named clients:

You can have several clients, that can be referenced by a name.
Every client can have a different provider assigned. If no provider is assigned to a named client, the global default
provider is used.

```typescript
import { OpenFeature, ProviderEvents } from '@openfeature/web-sdk';

OpenFeature.setProvider(new YourProviderOfChoice())
OpenFeature.setProvider("client-1", new YourOtherProviderOfChoice())

// Uses YourProviderOfChoice (the default)
const unnamedClient = OpenFeature.getClient()

// Uses YourOtherProviderOfChoice as it is set explicitly
const client1 = OpenFeature.getClient("client-1")

// Uses YourProviderOfChoice as no provider is set
const client2 = OpenFeature.getClient("client-2")
```

### Events:

Events provide a way to react to state changes in the provider or underlying flag management system.
You can listen to events of either the OpenFeature API or individual clients.

The events after initialization, `PROVIDER_READY` on success, `PROVIDER_ERROR` on failure during initialization,
are dispatched for every provider.
However, other event types may not be supported by your provider.
Please refer to the documentation of the provider you're using to see what events are supported.

```typescript
import { OpenFeature, ProviderEvents } from '@openfeature/web-sdk';

// OpenFeature API
OpenFeature.addHandler(ProviderEvents.Ready, (eventDetails) => {
  console.log(`Ready event from: ${eventDetails.clientName}:`, eventDetails);
});

// Specific client
const client = OpenFeature.getClient();
client.addHandler(ProviderEvents.Error, async (eventDetails) => {
  console.log(`Error event from: ${eventDetails.clientName}:`, eventDetails);
});
```

### Shutdown:

The OpenFeature API provides a close function to perform a cleanup of all registered providers.
This should only be called when your application is in the process of shutting down.

```typescript
import { OpenFeature, ProviderEvents } from '@openfeature/web-sdk';

await OpenFeature.close()
```
